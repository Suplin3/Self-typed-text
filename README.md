<h1>Self-typed text</h1>
<h3>
        This library, created for python, will allow you to easily create text that will print itself over time right in your console!
</h3>
<h2>Let's start</h2>
<p>
        In order to start using this library, you can download this repository, place the library file in your project and then import it.<br>
        <code>import selftyping</code>
</p>
<p>
        And you can use it with the built-in function <code>_print(text, delay)</code><br>
<code>import selftyping as st
 st._print("some text", 3)</code>
        <br> The delay value indicates the time it takes for the text to be printed in seconds
</p>
